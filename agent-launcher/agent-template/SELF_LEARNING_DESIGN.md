# Self-Learning Agent Enhancement Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for adding autonomous learning capabilities to the Accountable AI Agent. The agent will be able to learn on its own through two primary methods:

1. **Web Search Learning** - Automatically search for missing information when knowledge gaps are detected
2. **Owner Query System** - Create Firestore documents to ask the owner for clarification or new information

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components
- **Knowledge Service** (`services/knowledge_service.py`): Local embedding-based knowledge storage with semantic search
- **Firebase Integration** (`services/firebase_service.py`): Already connected to Firestore for data storage
- **Self-Reflection** (`core/accountable_agent.py`): Built-in accountability and self-reflection mechanisms
- **Tool Registry** (`services/tool_registry.py`): Extensible system for adding new capabilities
- **Conversation Manager** (`core/conversation_manager.py`): Handles conversation flow and context

### Missing Capabilities
- Knowledge gap detection during conversations
- Web search capabilities for autonomous knowledge acquisition
- Owner query system for human-in-the-loop learning
- Learning journey tracking and validation

## Self-Learning Architecture

### 1. Knowledge Gap Detection

#### Component: `core/knowledge_gap_detector.py`

**Purpose**: Analyze conversation context to identify when the agent lacks sufficient knowledge to provide a quality response.

**Key Features**:
- Confidence scoring for agent responses
- Context analysis to detect uncertainty markers
- Topic classification to identify knowledge domains
- Trigger thresholds for learning activation

**Detection Triggers**:
- Low confidence in response generation
- Explicit user queries about unknown topics
- Failed tool executions due to missing knowledge
- Uncertainty expressions in agent responses

**Implementation**:
```python
class KnowledgeGapDetector:
    def __init__(self, confidence_threshold=0.7):
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.uncertainty_markers = ["I don't know", "I'm not sure", "unclear", "uncertain"]
    
    async def detect_knowledge_gap(self, context: Dict, response: str, confidence: float) -> Dict:
        """
        Detect if there's a knowledge gap in the current conversation
        Returns: {has_gap: bool, gap_type: str, context: Dict, suggested_action: str}
        """
        pass
    
    def analyze_response_confidence(self, response: str) -> float:
        """Analyze response text for confidence indicators"""
        pass
```

### 2. Web Search Learning Module

#### Component: `services/web_search_service.py`

**Purpose**: Automatically search for and acquire new knowledge when gaps are detected.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple search provider integration (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Content extraction and summarization
- Source reliability scoring
- Knowledge validation and integration

**Search Workflow**:
1. Generate search queries based on knowledge gap context
2. Execute searches across multiple providers
3. Extract and summarize relevant content
4. Validate information credibility
5. Store in knowledge base with source metadata

**Implementation**:
```python
class WebSearchService:
    def __init__(self, providers=['google', 'bing', 'duckduckgo']):
        self.providers = providers
        self.content_extractor = ContentExtractor()
        self.credibility_scorer = CredibilityScorer()
    
    async def search_and_learn(self, query: str, context: Dict) -> Dict:
        """
        Search for information and integrate into knowledge base
        Returns: {success: bool, content: str, sources: List, confidence: float}
        """
        pass
    
    async def validate_search_results(self, results: List) -> List:
        """Validate and score search results for credibility"""
        pass
```

#### Content Extraction and Validation

**Features**:
- Web scraping with respect for robots.txt
- Content deduplication and summarization
- Source credibility assessment
- Fact-checking against existing knowledge

### 3. Owner Query System

#### Component: `services/owner_query_service.py`

**Purpose**: Create structured requests for owner input when autonomous learning is insufficient.

**Firestore Collections**:

4. **Multi-modal Learning**: Support for images, videos, documents
5. **Collaborative Learning**: Agent-to-agent knowledge sharing

## Conclusion

This self-learning enhancement will transform the agent from a static knowledge system to a dynamic, continuously improving AI assistant. By combining autonomous web search capabilities with human-in-the-loop learning through owner queries, the agent will become increasingly capable and specialized to its specific use cases.

The implementation follows a modular approach that integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture while providing clear extension points for future enhancements. The comprehensive tracking and analytics ensure transparency and continuous improvement of the learning process.
