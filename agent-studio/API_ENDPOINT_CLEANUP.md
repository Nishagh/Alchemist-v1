# API Endpoint Cleanup - Removed Non-Existent Endpoints

## Summary
Removed the `/api/agent-types` endpoint that doesn't exist in the backend and updated the code to use static agent types instead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Endpoint Configuration
- **File:** `src/services/config/apiConfig.js`
- **Change:** Removed `AGENT_TYPES: '/api/agent-types'` from ENDPOINTS
- **Reason:** Backend doesn't implement this endpoint

### 2. Updated Agent Service
- **File:** `src/services/agents/agentService.js`
- **Change:** Modified `getAgentTypes()` to return static data instead of making API call
- **Added Types:**
  - General Assistant
  - Code Assistant  
  - Research Assistant
  - Writing Assistant
  - Data Analyst
  - Customer Support

### 3. Simplified Component Logic
- **File:** `src/components/AgentEditor/AgentConfiguration/AgentConfigurationForm.js`
- **Change:** Simplified error handling since API call no longer fails
- **Benefit:** No more 405 errors in console

## Benefits

### ✅ **Improved User Experience**
- No more console errors for missing endpoint
- Agent types load instantly (no API delay)
- More predictable behavior

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- Eliminates unnecessary API call
- Faster component initialization
- Reduced server load

### ✅ **Enhanced Reliability**
- No dependency on backend endpoint that doesn't exist
- Agent configuration always works
- Consistent agent types across app

## Agent Types Available

The following agent types are now available as static options:

1. **General Assistant** - A versatile AI assistant
2. **Code Assistant** - Specialized in programming tasks
3. **Research Assistant** - Focused on research and analysis
4. **Writing Assistant** - Specialized in content creation and editing
5. **Data Analyst** - Focused on data analysis and insights
6. **Customer Support** - Designed for customer service interactions

## Future Considerations

If the backend eventually implements the `/api/agent-types` endpoint:

1. **Easy to restore:** Simply change `getAgentTypes()` back to make an API call
2. **Fallback strategy:** Keep static types as fallback if API fails
3. **Backward compatibility:** Current agent type IDs are designed to be compatible

## Error Resolution

**Before:**
```
ERROR: Failed to load resource: 405 /api/agent-types
ERROR: API Error: 405 /api/agent-types  
ERROR: Error getting agent types: AxiosError
```

**After:**
```
✅ No errors - agent types load instantly from static data
```
