# Billing Service Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from embedded billing system to dedicated billing microservice architecture.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Frontend Integration
- **Updated API Configuration**: Added billing service URL configuration in `apiConfig.js`
- **New Billing Service**: Created `billingServiceV2.js` that communicates with the billing microservice
- **Updated Credits Page**: Modified to use new billing service with backward compatibility
- **Authentication Integration**: Extended auth interceptors to include billing API calls
- **Environment Configuration**: Added `.env.example` with billing service configuration

### ✅ Cleanup - Removed Files
- `src/pages/Billing.js` - Redundant page (routes now point to Credits page)
- `src/services/billing/billingService.js` - Old billing service
- `src/services/credits/` - Entire old credits service directory
- `server/routes/billing.js` - Old billing routes
- `server/routes/credits.js` - Old credits routes  
- `server/routes/webhooks.js` - Old webhook routes
- `server/services/` - Entire server services directory
- `server/middleware/` - Entire middleware directory
- `server/schemas/` - Entire schemas directory

### ✅ Server Updates
- **Removed Billing Logic**: Cleaned up server.js to remove all billing/credits/webhook route handlers
- **Removed Middleware**: Removed credits checking and usage tracking middleware
- **Updated Dependencies**: Removed unused `mongoose` dependency
- **Added Comments**: Documented that billing functionality moved to microservice

### ✅ Service Architecture
- **Microservice Integration**: Frontend now communicates directly with billing microservice
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained same API interface for existing components
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for microservice communication
- **Authentication**: Preserved Firebase auth integration with billing service

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (agent-studio) → Billing Microservice → Firebase/Firestore
                                              → Razorpay
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Service Independence**: Billing scales independently
2. **Fault Isolation**: Billing failures don't affect main application
3. **Cross-Service Usage**: Other services can directly track usage via billing service
4. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified main application server

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Set `REACT_APP_BILLING_SERVICE_URL` to point to the live billing service:
```
REACT_APP_BILLING_SERVICE_URL=https://billing-service-851487020021.us-central1.run.app
```

### Routes Affected
- `/billing` → Points to Credits page
- `/credits` → Points to Credits page (using billing microservice)

## API Endpoints Now Handled by Billing Service
- `GET /api/v1/credits/balance` - Credit balance
- `GET /api/v1/credits/account` - Complete account info
- `GET /api/v1/credits/packages` - Available packages
- `POST /api/v1/credits/purchase` - Purchase credits
- `POST /api/v1/payments/verify` - Verify payments
- `GET /api/v1/transactions` - Transaction history
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/razorpay` - Payment webhooks

## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated frontend with new billing integration
2. Monitor billing service health and performance
3. Update other Alchemist services to use billing service for usage tracking
4. Consider adding caching layer for frequently accessed credit balances

## Rollback Plan
If needed, the old billing implementation can be restored from git history. However, the microservice architecture is recommended for production scalability.
