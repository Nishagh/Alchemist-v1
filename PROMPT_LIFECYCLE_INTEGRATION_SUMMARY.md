# System Prompt Update Lifecycle Event Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented system prompt update event tracking in the `agent_lifecycle_events` Firebase collection. The integration follows microservices best practices by having the prompt-engine service record lifecycle events when it performs prompt updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prompt Engine (`prompt-engine/`)

#### `main.py`
- Added import for `init_agent_lifecycle_service`
- Initialize lifecycle service during application startup
- Added lifecycle service status to health check endpoint

#### `routes.py`
- Added import for lifecycle service functions
- Modified `PromptInstructionsRequest` model to include optional `user_id` field
- Added background task `record_prompt_lifecycle_event()` for recording lifecycle events
- Integrated lifecycle event recording into the prompt update endpoint

#### Key Integration Points:
- Lifecycle events are recorded as background tasks to avoid blocking the API response
- Events include metadata about the prompt update (instructions, prompt length, action type)
- Only records events when `user_id` is provided in the request

### 2. Agent Engine (`agent-engine/`)

#### `routes.py`
- Modified the `/api/alchemist/interact` endpoint to pass `user_id` to orchestrator

#### `alchemist/agents/orchestrator_agent.py`
- Added `current_user_id` instance variable to store user context
- Modified `process()` method to accept and store `user_id` from input data
- Updated `update_agent_prompt` tool to include `user_id` in API calls to prompt-engine

### 3. Testing

#### `test_prompt_lifecycle.py`
- Created comprehensive test suite validating:
  - Lifecycle service initialization
  - Event recording functionality
  - Routes integration
- All tests pass successfully

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram:
```
User Request â†’ agent-engine â†’ orchestrator â†’ prompt-engine â†’ lifecycle event recorded
     â†“              â†“             â†“              â†“
[user_id]    [pass user_id]  [API call]   [background task]
```

### Event Recording Process:
1. User interacts with agent via agent-engine
2. Agent-engine extracts `user_id` from authentication
3. Orchestrator receives `user_id` and stores it for tool context
4. When `update_agent_prompt` tool is called, it includes `user_id` in API request
5. Prompt-engine processes the request and records lifecycle event asynchronously
6. Event is stored in `agent_lifecycle_events` collection with full metadata

## Collection Schema

Events are stored in the `agent_lifecycle_events` collection with this structure:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "string",
  "event_type": "prompt_update",
  "title": "System Prompt Updated",
  "description": "Agent's system prompt and behavior instructions were modified",
  "user_id": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "metadata": {
    "instructions": "string",
    "prompt_length": "number",
    "action": "created|updated",
    "prompt_preview": "string",
    "service": "prompt-engine"
  },
  "priority": "high",
  "event_id": "string"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Accountability**: Full audit trail of who changed agent prompts and when
2. **Compliance**: Proper tracking for regulatory requirements
3. **Debugging**: Easy to trace prompt evolution and correlate with agent behavior
4. **Analytics**: Data for understanding prompt modification patterns
5. **Microservices Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns - prompt-engine owns prompt update events

## Future Enhancements

1. **Web Dashboard**: Display lifecycle events in agent-studio UI
2. **Notifications**: Alert users to significant prompt changes
3. **Rollback**: Use lifecycle events to enable prompt version rollback
4. **Analytics**: Aggregate lifecycle data for insights into agent evolution

## Verification

Run the test suite to verify the integration:

```bash
python3 test_prompt_lifecycle.py
```

Expected output: `ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The prompt lifecycle integration is working correctly.`

## Database

Events are now being tracked in the `agent_lifecycle_events` Firebase collection as intended. The issue mentioned in the original request has been resolved.
