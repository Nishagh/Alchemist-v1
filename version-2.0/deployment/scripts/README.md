## üß† Smart Features

### Automatic Change Detection

The system automatically detects changes using two methods:

1. **Git-based Detection**: Compares current commit with last deployment
2. **Fingerprint-based Detection**: Compares file hashes of service directories

```bash
# Use specific detection method
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh auto --git
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh auto --fingerprint
```

### Intelligent Dependency Management

Services are deployed in the correct order based on their dependencies:

- **Tier 1**: Core services (agent-engine, knowledge-vault, prompt-engine)
- **Tier 2**: Integration services (agent-bridge, banking-api-service)  
- **Tier 3**: Infrastructure services (billing, monitoring, gnf)
- **Tier 4**: Tool services (tool-forge, sandbox-console, etc.)
- **Tier 5**: Frontend services (agent-studio, admin-dashboard)

### Health Monitoring & Rollback

Each deployment includes:
- Automated health checks
- Service URL verification
- Automatic rollback on critical failures
- Manual rollback capabilities

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Service Configuration (`config/service-config.yaml`)

Defines all services with:
- Dependencies and deployment order
- Resource requirements (CPU, memory, scaling)
- Environment variables
- Health check settings
- Cloud Run configuration

### Global Configuration (`config/deployment.yaml`)

Defines environment-specific settings:
- Project IDs and regions for each environment
- Deployment policies and safety settings
- Notification and integration settings
- Resource limits and security policies

## üîç Change Detection

### How It Works

1. **Git Method**: Compares files changed between last deployment commit and current commit
2. **Fingerprint Method**: Calculates MD5 hashes of all relevant files in service directories
3. **Shared Library Detection**: Automatically includes all services that use shared libraries when shared code changes

### What Triggers Deployment

- Source code changes (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, etc.)
- Configuration changes (`Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`)
- Shared library changes (affects all dependent services)
- Manual force deployment

### What's Ignored

- Documentation files (`.md`, `README`, etc.)
- Log files and temporary files
- Node modules and Python cache directories
- Git metadata

## üìä State Management

### Deployment State

The system maintains comprehensive state in `.deployment/state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "project_id": "alchemist-e69bb",
  "region": "us-central1", 
  "environment": "production",
  "last_deployment": {
    "commit": "abc123...",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-03 10:30:00",
    "user": "deploy-user"
  },
  "services": {
    "agent-engine": {
      "status": "success",
      "fingerprint": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
      "url": "https://agent-engine-service-url",
      "last_deployed": "2025-01-03 10:25:00"
    }
  },
  "deployment_history": [...]
}
```

### Backup Management

- Automatic backups before each deployment
- Configurable retention (default: 10 backups)
- Export/import capabilities for disaster recovery

### Deployment History

Complete audit trail of all deployments:
- Service name and status
- Deployment timestamp and commit
- Error messages and rollback actions
- Performance metrics

## üè• Health Checking

### Service Health Checks

Each service has configurable health checks:

```yaml
health_check:
  path: "/health"           # Health check endpoint
  timeout: 30              # Request timeout in seconds
  retries: 3               # Number of retry attempts
  expected_status: "200"   # Expected HTTP status code
  expected_content: ""     # Optional content validation
```

### Health Check Types

1. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Checks service endpoints
2. **TCP**: Checks port connectivity
3. **Command**: Runs custom health check commands

### Automatic Rollback

Services are automatically rolled back if:
- Health checks fail after deployment
- Response times exceed thresholds
- Error rates are too high
- Service becomes unresponsive

## üîÑ Rollback System

### Automatic Rollback

```bash
# Enable automatic rollback monitoring (default: 3 minutes)
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh auto --auto-rollback

# Custom monitoring duration
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh auto --auto-rollback --monitor-duration 300
```

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous revision
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh rollback agent-engine

# Rollback to specific revision
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh rollback agent-engine --revision revision-name

# Rollback multiple services
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh rollback agent-engine knowledge-vault
```

### Snapshots

Create and restore service snapshots:

```bash
# Create snapshot before risky deployment
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh snapshot agent-engine

# List available snapshots
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh list-snapshots

# Restore from snapshot
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh restore snapshot-name
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Override project settings
export ALCHEMIST_PROJECT_ID="my-project"
export ALCHEMIST_REGION="us-west1"
export ALCHEMIST_ENV="staging"

# Skip confirmations (useful for CI/CD)
export SKIP_CONFIRMATIONS="true"

# Enable debug logging
export DEBUG="true"
```

### Parallel Deployment

```bash
# Enable parallel deployment within tiers
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh all --parallel --max-parallel 3

# Deploy specific group in parallel
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh group tools --parallel
```

### Force Deployment

```bash
# Force deploy all services (ignore change detection)
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh all --force

# Force deploy specific services
./deployment/scripts/deploy-smart.sh services agent-engine --force
```

### Custom Timeouts

```bash
