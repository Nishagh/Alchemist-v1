# Alchemist Platform - Post-Migration Service Deployment Script
# This script deploys all services after the Firestore migration is complete
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy-all-services.sh              # Interactive mode selection
#   ./deploy-all-services.sh --manual     # Use predefined service lists
#   ./deploy-all-services.sh --auto       # Auto-discover services with deploy.sh
#
# Features:
# - Auto-discovers services with deploy.sh scripts
# - Prioritizes individual service deploy.sh scripts over generic gcloud deploy
# - Manual mode for controlled phased deployment
# - Auto mode for comprehensive deployment of all services
# - Health checks for all deployed services
