./scripts/cleanup.sh --service-only           # Only delete the Cloud Run service
./scripts/cleanup.sh --dry-run                # Show what would be deleted
```

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, ensure you have:

1. **Google Cloud SDK** installed and configured
2. **Docker** installed (for local builds)
3. **Go** installed (for local development)
4. **Proper authentication** with Google Cloud

## Quick Start

1. **Setup development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy the service** (use the main deployment script):
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor the service:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor.sh status
   ./scripts/monitor.sh test
   ```

4. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor.sh logs 50
   ```

5. **Clean up when done:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cleanup.sh
   ```

## Integration with Main Scripts

These utility scripts are designed to work with:
- `../deploy.sh` - Main deployment script
- `../manage.sh` - Interactive management console

Use the management console for a user-friendly interface:
```bash
./manage.sh
```

## Error Handling

All scripts include:
- ‚úÖ Prerequisites checking
- ‚úÖ Error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Colored output for better readability
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging and status messages
- ‚úÖ Safe cleanup with confirmations

## Configuration

Scripts use these default values:
- **Service Name:** `openapi-mcp-converter`
- **Region:** `us-central1`
- **Memory:** `512Mi`
- **CPU:** `1`
- **Max Instances:** `10`

These can be modified in the individual scripts if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied**: Make sure scripts are executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. **gcloud not authenticated**: 
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Missing APIs**: Scripts will automatically enable required APIs

4. **Service not found**: Check if the service is deployed
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor.sh status
   ```

### Getting Help

Each script supports the `--help` or `-h` flag:
```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh --help
./scripts/cleanup.sh --help
```

For the main deployment script:
```bash
./deploy.sh --help
```
